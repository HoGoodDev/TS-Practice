# TypeScript Practice 

**TypeScript Practice** is a personal repo where I build small projects and exercises to learn and master TypeScript. Itâ€™s a hands-on playground to explore TypeScript syntax, features, and best practices through practical coding.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HoGoodDev/TS-Practice.git
cd TS-Practice
npm install  # if you have dependencies
npx tsc      # compile TypeScript to JavaScript
node ./compiled/<your-entry-file>.js
```

Replace `<your-entry-file>` with the compiled JavaScript file you want to run.
